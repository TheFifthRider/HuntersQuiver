## Hunter's Quiver

A [Vintage Story](https://github.com/anegostudios) mod.

Simple little content mod that makes Quivers craftable! Also they hold hunting stuff!

Quivers cost 6 leather and a plate of copper, bronze, iron, or steel and are effectively 10 slot alternatives to mining bags.

I put screenshots of everything that goes in the bags at time of writing-- I'll either keep those up to date or I'll start exhaustively documenting down here, we'll see which path I choose in the long run.


Mod Compatibility:

Butchering drops, bone arrowheads, bone needles, and hooks fit in the quiver.
Primitive Survival fishing equipment and drops fit in the quiver.
Smithing Plus' metal bits that drop as broken arrowheads fit in the quiver.
Wildcraft: Trees and Shrubs not overwriting the storage flags set by Wildcraft so overlapping items fit in both your quiver and your foraging basket.
