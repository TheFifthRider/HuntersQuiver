# Hunter's Quiver

A [Vintage Story](https://github.com/anegostudios) mod.

Simple little content mod that makes Quivers craftable! Also they hold hunting stuff!

Quivers cost 6 leather and a plate of copper, bronze, iron, or steel and are effectively 10 slot alternatives to mining bags.

## Mod Compatibility:

* **Butchering** drops, bone arrowheads, bone needles, and hooks fit in the quiver.
* **Primitive Survival** fishing equipment and drops fit in the quiver.
* **Smithing Plus**' metal bits that drop as broken arrowheads fit in the quiver.
* **Wildcraft: Trees and Shrubs** not overwriting the storage flags set by Wildcraft so overlapping items fit in both your quiver and your foraging basket.
